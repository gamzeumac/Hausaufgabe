          If I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner, my inability
          to perform well would neither surprise nor bother me. But why should I
          have trouble with doors and light switches, water faucets and stoves?
          “Doors?” I can hear the reader saying. “You have trouble opening
          doors?” Yes. I push doors that are meant to be pulled,
          <b>quote</b>pull doors that should be pushed, and walk into doors that
          neither pull nor push, but slide. Moreover, I see others having the
          same troubles—unnecessary troubles. My problems with doors have become
          so well known that confusing doors are often called “Norman doors.”
          Imagine becoming famous for doors that don’t work right. I’m pretty
          sure that’s not what my parents planned for me. (Put “Norman doors”
          into your favorite search engine—be sure to include the
          <b>quote</b> marks: it makes for fascinating reading.) How can such a
          simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be about
          as simple a device as possible. There is not much you can do to a
          door: you can open it or shut it. Suppose you are in an office
          building, walking down a corridor. You come to a door. How does it
          open? Should you push or pull, on the left or the right? Maybe the
          door slides. If so, in which direction? I have seen doors that slide
          to the left, to the right, and even up into the ceiling.
